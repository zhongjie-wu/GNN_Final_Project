# GNN_Final_Project

## Overview
This project focuses on experiments in node and graph classification using different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It includes two main experiments, each provided as a separate Google Colab notebook.

As the environment has been set up in Colab, there's no special requirements or environment dependencies. To reproduce the experiment results, simply follow the instructions within each notebook to run the experiments.
